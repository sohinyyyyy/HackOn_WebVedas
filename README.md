# ♻Vasudha-Eco

Vasudha (वसुधा) means Earth in Sanskrit.
Eco represents ecological sustainability.

Together, VasudhaEco symbolizes a commitment to protecting and preserving the planet through eco-friendly actions.

VasudhaEco App aims to improve recycling rates and reduce landfill waste by incentivizing responsible waste disposal.

 Users can log their recyclable waste, and upon validation by the waste management department, receive rewards proportional to the weight of the collected materials. 
 
 This system fosters transparency, encourages citizen participation, and streamlines the waste collection process.
